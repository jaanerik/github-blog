In this post we will introduce the problem of finding the Viterbi path of triplet Markov chains. Then we will describe one way to approximate the path using methods from variational infrence.

## Triplet Markov chains and Viterbi path

{% raw %}
  Let $$\{Z_t\}_t$$ be a Markov chain with an initial probability distribution $$\pi$$ and transition probability $$p$$. A triplet Markov chain can be described when we have $$Z_t = (U_t,X_t,Y_t)$$. 
 {% endraw %}

## Variational infrence on discrete probability distributions

As concluded in the previous chapter, we are interested in discrete probability distributions. This is much easier than what others usually focus o n [in literature](https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/mbeal/thesis/).

Test 1, $$\varepsilon + 2 = 2.2$$, test 3
