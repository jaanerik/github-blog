In this post we will introduce the problem of finding the Viterbi path of triplet Markov chains. Then we will describe one way to approximate the path using methods from variational infrence.

## Triplet Markov chains and Viterbi path

{% raw %}
Let $$\{Z_t\}_t$$ be a Markov chain with an initial probability distribution $$\pi$$ and (homogeneous) transition matrix $$p$$. A triplet Markov chain can be described when we have $$Z_t = (U_t,X_t,Y_t)$$. Introducing the extra variables has the following goal --- we can describe a fixed data variable $$\bm{y}$$, do inference to find properties about $$\bm{X}$$ that we are interested in while incorporating the effects of a nuisance variable $$\bm{U}$$ in our model. Triplet Markov chains generalise pairwise Markov chains that have been both studied by JÃ¼ri Lember in Tartu University. It is easy to see that these models generalise Markov chains and hidden Markov models.

Let us fix the observations $$\bm{y}$$. We can describe the process $$\{U_t,X_t | \bm{y}\}_t\}$$ as an inhomogeneous pairwise Markov chain with a transition matrix at timestep $$t$$ as $$p_t$$. We can introduce the{% endraw %}  **Viterbi path problem** {% raw %} as finding the solution for the following:

$$ \max_{\bm{x}} \sum_{\bm{u}} p_t(\bm{u},\bm{x}). $$
{% endraw %}

## Variational infrence on discrete probability distributions

As concluded in the previous chapter, we are interested in discrete probability distributions. This is much easier than what others usually focus o n [in literature](https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/mbeal/thesis/).
