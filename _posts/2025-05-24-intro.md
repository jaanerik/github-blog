There have been many interesting applications of the free energy principle in many fields. In this post we shall go over a novel way of using variational Bayes methods in Viterbi path estimation in triplet Markov chains.

{% raw %}
  $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ --> note that all equations between these tags will not need escaping! 
 {% endraw %}

Test 1, $$\varepsilon + 2 = 2.2$$, test 3


Whathappen

Tere \(R^2\) or (R^3) tere!
